# 👋 Hi, I'm Alison Klepetka

I'm a grounded analyst, organizer, and tech steward living in rural Michigan.  
I believe in transparency, shared power, and building tools that help people **actually understand** the systems that shape their communities.

## 💡 Projects

- 🏞️ [CORA Transparency Hub](https://github.com/AlisonKlepetka/cora-transparency-hub) — Making public data actually public
- 🧰 Drive Tracker — Google Apps Script for mapping and auditing folder structures
- ❄️ [The Mudroom](https://themudroomwhitecloud.org/) (Coming Soon) — A gear hub, learning space, and creative outpost for White Cloud's wild-hearted...

## 🧭 What I Value

- Clarity over jargon  
- Public records that stay public  
- Design that respects people's time  
- Tech that helps neighbors help each other

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always up for collaborating on:
- Community tools
- Accessible documentation
- Local environmental research
- Plain language systems mapping
